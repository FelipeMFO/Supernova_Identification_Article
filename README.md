# Supernova Identification

Source code and processed data from the Article 

For practical reasons, different steps of the data frames used on this project were saved on pickle files. 

Those pickles will be available for download at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FP3515CzNqQJY0PZFSWT9y7gC8ldi8pm?usp=sharing as well as the raw data.

They must be unzipped inside a <data/> folder on the root of this project. Inside the <data/> folder there will be 2 following folders: <data/raw_data/> containing all the .txt raw files and the <data/processed/> containing all the pickles used on the notebooks during the different parts of the project.
